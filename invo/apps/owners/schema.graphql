# TODO: think about site flow in relation to a recent sign up.
# A user should be forced to either get added to someones Site or register their own.
# A user is only allowed one Site for "unpaid" account but can be added to others
# When they register a valid site they're forwarded to that sub domain automatically
# Let them know they can book mark this sub-domain to get back to their stuff quicker
# Add site switching menu in the top left. Main app bar shows current space or site name.
